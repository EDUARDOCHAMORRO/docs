# Documentation guide

This is a guide for documentation on your student drive
with a focus on internal R&D projects.
It specifies *why documentation is important*, *what to document*, and *how to* do it.
It is a living draft, reflecting our current established practices.

If you just want to see examples of existing projects,

## Motivation

Documentation serves multiple, complimentary purposes.

Awareness
Possibilities
Inspiration
Marketing, PR
Tips & Tricks, Best pratices

## What to document

One-offs versus generally-useful parts


### How to - While you work

* Take pictures.
Most important is the finished part,
but in-progress/process photographs are always nice to have.
Use smartphone, or borrow camera from office.

* Take notes.
Learned something new in the process?
Something that did not work out as expected?
Got any ideas for further work?
What have gone wrong and what your learned from it?

### Complete documentation

Update your student folder in the drive and keep it clean. Tag properly each file with the proper naming convention and the date of the file.


Your ¨repo¨ should include:

- Project source files: `Grasshopper`/`Sketchup`/`Rhino`/`FreeCAD`/`Illustator`/`Inkscape`/`Blender`/etc
- Exported cutsheet geometry. As `.DXF` file(s)
- 3d-model for visualization. As `.STL` file
- (optional) 3d-model for general reuse. As `.STEP`
- (optional) Toolpath/CAM project: VCarve .vcr
- Your final and documentation pictures
- presentation and include the workfile.`Illustrator`/ `Indesign`/etc

(Recommended)

Documenting in Markdown
- Rising tendence
- Easy to write, fast and clean compared to HTML
- 10 minutes [tutorial] (http://markdowntutorial.com/)

You can edit this with text editor, or use the online version.

[dillinger](https://dillinger.io/).
[stackedit](https://stackedit.io/).


To use the online editor, go to the project repository,
click README.md in webinterface, then the edit button on top.
It is nice because it has `Preview` feature, so it is easy to check.

It is nice to use markdown as an easy sintax text editor that allow easy conversion on html and other formats.

### Spread the word (for each module)

* Make a new post on Iaac Blog [IaacBlog](http://www.iaacblog.com/).
Include a picture, short description and *proper links and source references for more details.*
Ask `IaaC Office` for access.
* Follow the Iaac Blog publication guidelines to ensure proper tagging and correct editint [Guidelines](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6cIj8JAKs2rVTNYNEg2c093M2s)

## Ideas

* Tell your story, not a step by step tutorial. Is what you did, not what to do
* Try to use a proper camera to take the pictures and check if you need to use tripod to avoid blurry.
* Size (web size). There is something even worse than a blurred image, and it
is a 16 Mpx blurred image.
* Composition: Rule of thirds
* Lighting. Beware of flash
* Videos (SAY NO! TO VERTICAL VIDEOS), upload them in youtube or vimeo and link from the web.
* Consider  short videos (10~60sec)

* Dedicating some physical space to keep your work space and background of the pictures clean
Camera could be WiFi-enabled and automatically upload the images to docstation computer.
Also use a photobox/lightbox, to help take nice pictures.Documentation is very important.
